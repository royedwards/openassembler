# OpenAssembler #
OpenAssembler is a tool to handle any type of data which is representable in a node-based structure. Mainly focusing on the vfx problems of course.
You can easily create any new node with a python knowledge, and you can use it with connecting to the others. There is no limitation at all what modules you can use in your node, it is up to you.
You can create any type of user interface over the nodes useing the gateway system or better useing the port communication system. Thre is no guideline, you can do what you want and you will be able to reach the specific variables which are connected to any nodes in your scene.
## The Aim ##
  * To create a flexible node based interface, and to create a branch of usefull nodes to start the work with.
  * To create an environment where you can develope any tipe of gui over a specific node network.
  * To able to use the same interface for all of your software component

## For who ##
  * For all the artists wanted to use high-end tools without codeing knowledge
  * For all the technical artists, TD's, to extend the knowledge with new nodes, nem interfaces
  * For programmers to do what they want with it :)
  * For everybody... most importantly...
